# Engineering 3 Notebook

This is where all of our stuff will go!

## Hello Python

### Lessons Learned

This assignment allowed us to become more familiar with how Python's format and syntax. It is much different than programming for the Arduino but after a coding for a bit we got used to it. By the end of the assignment, 
we knew how to write 'for' loops and print strings.

## Python - Calculator

### Lessons Learned

In this assignment we learned how to use user input to create a functioning interface, and we learned how to create and use functions. With this knowledge, we created a calculator program that adds, subtracts, multiplies,
and divides numbers, as well as finding modulos. We can easily add more operations if needed since we contained the calculations within a single function.

## Python - Quad Solver

### Lessons Learned
		
The knowledge we gained from the calculator assignment helped us complete this one fairly easily. The only thing we had to research was how to find the square root of a number ( import math & math.sqrt() ). We spent
some extra time writing code to format the equation in a neat manner but the math side of this assignment was fairly easy.
