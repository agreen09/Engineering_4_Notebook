# Engineering 3 Notebook

This is where all of our stuff will go!

##Hello Python

	###Lessons Learned
		This assignment allowed us to become more familiar with how Python's format and syntax. It is much different than programming for the Arduino but after a coding for a bit we got used to it. By the end of the assignment, 
		we knew how to write 'for' loops and print strings.

##Python - Calculator

	###Lessons Learned
		In this assignment we learned how to use user input to create a functioning interface, and we learned how to create and use functions. With this knowledge, we created a calculator program that adds, subtracts, multiplies,
		and divides numbers, as well as finding modulos. We can easily add more operations if needed since we contained the calculations within a single function. 

##Python - Quad Solver
