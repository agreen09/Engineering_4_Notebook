# Useful Side Projects

These are mini-projects that we started during our Engineering 4 Curriculum that we found useful enough to save for later.

## Battery Tester

While working on our "headless" assignment, we created a python script to test the life of a battery powering a Raspberry Pi. It writes to a file every 10 seconds with data containing whether the connected battery is low or not, using 
the LBO pin on the PowerBoost chip.
